# Meme Names

This is a simple code snippet originally made for Magnifica's upcoming title, and adapted to a published stand-alone website for fun. It concatenates a (hopefully) humerous username from a base name with optional prefix, suffix and wrapper, all randomly selected from arrays.

# WARNING: Contains Strong Language!

## Technologies
Bootstrap and Jquery.


## Launch
